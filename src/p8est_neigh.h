 * MPI implementations of MPI Neighborhood collectives will be flexible in
 * their algorithms that \a p8est_neigh_t becomes redundant.  But as of this
 * writing in 2018, popular MPI implementations only have loop-over-neighbors
 * implementations of neighborhoods */

 * information about the subsets of the space-filling curve owned by each
 * process can be used to scheduling the communication pattern of neighborhood
 * collectives.
